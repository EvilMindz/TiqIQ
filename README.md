Solution 1: You will find Solution1.png image in the root folder. Task Duration: < 5 mins

Solution 2: After successfully building and executing QuizApp.Web project, the hero image will be displayed on the index page centered on the screen Task Duration:  15 mins

Solution 3: When you click on the hero image, it will scroll to the data display from the solution 1. The service is built using restful WCF and it returns a JSON response upon GET request. Since I wasn't sure whether to load the data from the database I prepared and tested the data using datatables and accessed them using Linq to Datatables.I have also attached a corresponding unit test. Task Duration: 70 mins

Caution: I have left out other common aspects of programming like exception handling and logging, dependency injection, ORM, object mapping, DDD, TDD etc.
